# MovieProject
My first movie app that allows users to find popular or top rated movies using a flexible UI that works with phones or tablets.

# Features
 The app allows users to:
 
  * Find top rated or popular movies that are currently out.
  * Click on thumbnails to discover the synopsis of each movie.
  
# How this app works
  The MovieProject is able to retreive information about these movies using an API from themovieDB.org in which they 
  give you your own personal API key.
  
# Libraries

  * Butterknife
